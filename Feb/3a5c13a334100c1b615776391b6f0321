The powerful earthquake that struck southernÂ TÃ¼rkiye on Monday morning hasÂ damagedÂ a natural gas pipeline in the region, state energy company BOTAS has confirmed. Videos circulating online show massive plumes of flame erupting into the air. The 7.4-magnitude quake has killed scores of people and caused significant damage to civilian and municipal infrastructure, according to Turkish officials. BOTAS said it has cut supply in the wake of the tremor, but the rupture in the Kilis province is being fed by the gas inside the pipeline. Videos purportedly shot on the scene show massive plumes of fire rising high into the sky in at least two locations. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·#Earthquake in #Turkey.#Hatay: "Natural gas pipelines in Amik plain in Hatay burst with the force of the earthquake.
