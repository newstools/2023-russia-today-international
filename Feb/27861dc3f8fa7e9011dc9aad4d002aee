Tens of thousands of Germans braved the elements to attend the Uprising for Peace, a massive rally organized by Die Linke (Left Party) politician Sahra Wagenknecht and author Alice Schwarzer on Saturday. The demonstrators massed at the Brandenburg Gate, calling for peace talks to end the conflict in Ukraine and demanding Berlin cease supplying Kiev with weapons. Wagenknecht slammed the German government for trying to "ruin Russia," urging leaders to make Moscow an "offer" so that peace talks could begin. The rally, she said, represented the "start of a citizensâ€™ initiative" and the launch of a "new, strong peace movement in Germany." 50,000 protesters came to the huge peace rally in Berlin, Germany today.They are demanding an end to Europe's escalation of the NATO proxy war in Ukraine and immediate peace talks https://t.co/vk3I62yRYrâ€” Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) February 25, 2023 50,000 protesters came to the huge peace rally in Berlin, Germany today.They are demanding an end to Europe's escalation of the NATO proxy war in Ukraine and immediate peace talks https://t.co/vk3I62yRYr The rally welcomed protesters from across the political spectrum, declaring anyone who wanted peace "with an honest heart" was welcome, though neo-Nazi provocateurs jostling for media attention were not.
