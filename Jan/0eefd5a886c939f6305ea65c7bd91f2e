A Yeti Airlines ATR 72 plane with 68 passengers and four crew members on board crashed in Nepal during a domestic flight from the capital, Kathmandu, to Pokhara on Sunday. A video posted on social media appears to show the jet flying at low altitude moments before the tragedy. Some initial reports claimed that all people on board were feared dead. However, Gurudatta Dhakal, a local official, told AFP that “some survivors” were sent to a hospital. A senior administrative official, Tek Bahadur K.C., was later quoted by the agency as saying that 68 people were confirmed dead. Six children were among the passengers, the Kathmandu Post said. According to reports, the plane crashed while trying to land at Pokhara International Airport amid inclement weather conditions. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has convened an emergency government meeting to coordinate the rescue efforts. All flights from the Pokhara airport have been suspended.
